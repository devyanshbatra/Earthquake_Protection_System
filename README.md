Earthquake Surveillance and Management System
Overview

This project aims to develop a system that can protect individuals from earthquake-related injuries and property damage. The system will detect earthquake tremors and automatically trigger safety mechanisms to secure individuals within enclosed spaces.

Key Features:

Earthquake Detection: Utilizes seismic sensors to detect earthquake tremors.
Automatic Enclosure: Deploys a cage-like structure to protect individuals within the enclosure.
Water Supply Cut-off: Shuts off the water supply to prevent short circuits and water damage.
Power Supply Cut-off: Disconnects the power supply to prevent electrical fires.
Health Monitoring: Tracks the user's heart rate and blood oxygen levels.
Emergency Alert: Sends alerts to emergency services with the user's location.
Automated Defibrillation: Delivers an electric shock if necessary to restore heart rhythm.
Technical Specifications:

Seismic Sensors: High-sensitivity sensors to detect even minor tremors.
Microcontroller: Powerful microcontroller to process sensor data and control actuators.
Actuators: Motors, solenoids, and relays to control the enclosure, water supply, and power supply.
Power Supply: Backup battery to ensure system operation during power outages.
Communication Module: For sending alerts and receiving commands.
Health Monitoring Sensors: Heart rate and SpO2 sensors for user health monitoring.
GPS Module: For tracking the user's location.
Future Work:

Enhance the system's accuracy and reliability through advanced sensor technologies.
Develop more sophisticated algorithms for detecting and responding to earthquake events.
Integrate the system with existing smart home technologies for seamless integration.
Conduct extensive testing and validation to ensure the system's effectiveness and safety.
By implementing this innovative system, we can significantly reduce the risks associated with earthquakes and protect lives.
